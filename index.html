          <h3>Battle of Lexington and Concord (1775)</h3>
          <p>The Battle of Lexington and Concord took place on April 19, 1775, in Massachusetts. The British army, led
            by General Thomas Gage, fought against the American colonial militia, led by Captain John Parker. The
            outcome of the battle was a loss for the British, as the colonial militia was able to push them back. This
            battle was important because it marked the beginning of the armed conflict between the American colonies and

          <h3>Siege of Boston (1775)</h3>
          <p>The Siege of Boston started on April 19, 1775, after the battles of Lexington and Concord. General George
            Washington and the American militia surrounded the city where the British army, led by General Thomas Gage,
            was stationed. The siege went on for almost a year until the British troops left on March 17, 1776. This
            event was important because it proved that the American forces could effectively surround and put pressure
            on the British soldiers. It showed that the Americans were determined to stand up against the British and
            fight for their beliefs.</p>

          <h3>Battle of Trenton (1776)</h3>

            Washington and his soldiers crossed the icy Delaware River to surprise the Hessian mercenaries, who were
            fighting for the British. Even though the American troops were facing tough winter weather and low spirits,
            they won a big victory by capturing more than 1,000 enemy soldiers. This win was a big moment in the war,
            lifting American morale and showing that they could overcome challenges. While there were no famous foreign
            people involved in the Battle of Trenton, the success of this bold military move showed Washington's smart
            planning and the determination of the American forces to gain their freedom.</p>
